Version 1.0!

This is my version 1.0 based on prueker's METARMap project https://github.com/prueker/METARMap

All changes I've made have built on his core code. While much has changed, the core of the weather fetching code is unchanged.
I've changed "wx_string" to "precip" as I found that to be a more accurate description.

The majority of my changes have been to the animations. I wasn't satisfied with the wind animation.
New animations include: A more sexy fade for "windy" airports. A blinking animation for snow as well as a flashing animation for lightning. Maybe more to come!
Full transparency: I used AI to help with the creation of the new animations. If the code looks a bit wonky, it's because I'm not much of a coder ;)

I plan on making a comprehensive video of a full start to finish implementation of this code. 

Big thanks to prueker for getting me started on this project!
